    It can be occurred due to poor wiring in the house or lightning strikes or faulty appliances or damaged power lines. Surges are common and last for a microsecond but if you experience frequent surges lead to equipment damage that degrade life expectancy particularly.

Check the device that connects to the home grid or the wiring and try disconnecting the poor quality powerboards or devices from the outlet. If the surges don’t occur again, your problem is solved. If it is not, you must call an electrician.</p>

    Sometimes your light fixture has a bulb or other fitting with high watts than the designed fixture. This is a code violation and the risk level is quite high. The high heat from the bulb can melt the socket and insulation present in wires of the fixture. This results in sparks from one wire to another and causes electrical fires. Even after the bulb is removed, the socket and wires will still be under damage.

It is always better to fit a bulb or any other fittings by staying within the wattage. If the fixtures are not marked with wattage, it is advisable to use a 60-watt bulb or even smaller ones.

    When the electricity is not properly used, it results in electrical shocks with a nasty experience. The chances of such electrical problems in old homes were quite high because the circuits fitted during older days. An electric shock happens when you switch on or off a device. The issue can either be with the appliance or the wiring. To check the issue, you can test with another device. But to be on the safer side, just talk with your electrician to resolve the issues.

    It is a code violation to place tandem breakers in one slot rather than too many single-pole breakers. The difference between double-pole breakers and tandem breakers are that the latter one doesn’t take up two slots in a single circuit. The danger level will be minimal. This problem can be resolved by adding a sub-panel with extra slots or replacing the existing panel with a bigger model.
