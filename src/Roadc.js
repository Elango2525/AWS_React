Construction zones with uneven pavement are also a major cause of accidents.</p>

    There are several types of bad driving situations which exist throughout the state of Tennessee, including:

Potholes: Severe accidents can occur when blacktop or asphalt are missing in large chunks from the road.
Ice patches: Ice patches can form even without rain or snow. They typically form in isolated areas on the road.
Shoulder drop-off: A drop-off region can present a serious danger to drivers.
Oil and chip: These are temporary fixes on roads before they are resurfaced. Oil and chip areas can become slippery when left for extended periods of time.
Construction work zones: Lanes shift and uneven roads are some of the issues involved in construction areas.
Slick roads: Slippery surfaces cause hydroplaning to occur
