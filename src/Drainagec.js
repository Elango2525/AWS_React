      We are totally five hundred families residing in our locality. 
    We are facing a severe problem of growing problems of blockageof drainage for 
    the last 2 months in our locality.
    This blockagein drainage causes the problem of bad odour and leads to growth of mosquitoes which may lead to malaria. 
    Small children playing outside the door have already affected by diarrhoea. Sometimes we feel vomiting and nausea.
    We have already given many complaints to our local authority. They are always giving us empty promises and doing nothing. 
    So kindly am requesting you to look into this matter personally. 
    If you do the needful then i shall be very much thankful to you.</p>

      I am sorry to report that the drainage system in our locality leaves much to be desired. The present drainage system is so defective that a good shower would create the whole area into a collection of small lakes and pools. The clogging of rain-water in some of these parts of the city becomes as deep as three feet. Consequently the whole traffic is dislocated and life comes to a grinding halt during rains.

    We are facing a severe problem of growing problems of overflow of drainage for the last three months in our locality. This overflow in drainage causes the problem of bad odour and leads to growth of mosquitoes which may lead to malaria. Small children playing outside the door have already been affected by diarrhoea.
